# Indicators of Degraded Land - Africa Explorer

This repo, specifically  ```main.js```, holds the code written inside of Google Earth Engine in May 2023 for Thien Nguyen's work at the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minneosta. This code cannot be run outside of the Google Earth Engine online code editor without substantial changes to the codebase. 

Note: Missing is the Google Earth Engine ```geometry``` object used to cut out the borders of the countries outside of Africa.
